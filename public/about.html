<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Dpenha, I am originally Indian but I curently live in the United Kingdom, I love to read and I spend a lot of time learning new things.</p>

<p>My new hobby is trading on the stock market, I only trade Forex, because the market is open 24 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
  I am now learning to code and this is one of my first projects that I am doing, I think its really exciting.</p>


<p>I also work as a Sous Chef at a restaurant in North Wales, Food has always been my comfort and having to work with it everyday really makes me happy. The adrenaline rush that comes from doing a busy service is really addicting. I also have experiece of working as a flight attendent, as a kid I always looked forward to summer vacations, as that meant I got to sit in an aircraft for holidays, so growing up and doing that as a job was really a dream come true.</p>
